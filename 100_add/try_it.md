# Try it

Refresh the browser and you should see the `Add Player` button on the top right. Clicking this button should trigger a POST request to the server, which will return a new player with an id. Then `CreatePlayerDone` will trigger and the browser location should change to the new player's edit view.

For reference, up to this point your application code should look like <https://github.com/sporto/elm-tutorial-app/tree/100-add-player>.
