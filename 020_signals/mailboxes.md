# Mailboxes

`foldp` is an important building block for building applications. Another important building block are Mailboxes.

So far we have been listening to a "raw" signal like `Mouse.x` and using that for displaying information on the page. In a larger application we want to be able to react to the user's interaction with UI elements. For example clicking on a link or button.

In Elm we use __mailboxes__ for this. A mailbox is a communication hub that receives messages from UI elements and tasks and broadcasts a signal.

To understand this better, let's start by creating a page with a button:

```elm
module Main (..) where

import Html exposing (Html)


view : String -> Html
view message =
  Html.div
    []
    [ Html.div [] [ Html.text message ]
    , Html.button [] [ Html.text "Click" ]
    ]


messageSignal : Signal String
messageSignal =
  Signal.constant "Hello"


main : Signal Html
main =
  Signal.map view messageSignal
```

<https://github.com/sporto/elm-tutorial-assets/blob/master/code/signals/Mailbox01.elm>

`view` displays a message and a button for us to click. The button does nothing so far.

`messageSignal` is a `String` signal with the constant value of "Hello", meaning it never changes.

`main` maps the latest value from `messageSignal` to `view`. If you run this code in your browser you will see `Hello` which is the constant value coming from `messageSignal`.

## Adding interaction

We want to be able to click on the button and change the message. To do this we will use __Html.Events.onClick__. If you read the documentation for the __Html.Events__ module, you will see that all events have the same signature: `Signal.Address a -> a -> Html.Attribute`

They take a `Signal.Address` of any type as first argument, the same type as second argument and return an `Html.Attribute`.

But what is an `Address`?

## Addresses

An __address__ is a pointer to a specific signal. It allows us to send __messages__ to that signal.

To obtain an __address__ to send messages to, we need to use a `Mailbox`.

## Mailbox

You create a __mailbox__ like this:

```elm
mb : Signal.Mailbox String
mb =
  Signal.mailbox ""
```

`mb` is a function that returns a `Mailbox`. This specific mailbox deals with strings, i.e. it receives messages of type `String` and returns a signal of type `String`. The argument is the default value for the signal the mailbox provides, in this case it is the empty string.

This function returns the mailbox which is a record with two attributes:

```elm
{ address : Signal.Address a
, signal : Signal.Signal a
}
```

This record has the `address` we can send messages to and the `signal` that we can listen to.

## Using the mailbox

The next step is to use the mailbox in our application so we can send and refresh messages.


```elm
module Main (..) where

import Html exposing (Html)
import Html.Events as Events


view : Signal.Address String -> String -> Html
view address message =
  Html.div
    []
    [ Html.div [] [ Html.text message ]
    , Html.button
        [ Events.onClick address "Hello"
        ]
        [ Html.text "Click" ]
    ]


mb : Signal.Mailbox String
mb =
  Signal.mailbox ""


main : Signal Html
main =
  Signal.map (view mb.address) mb.signal
```

<https://github.com/sporto/elm-tutorial-assets/blob/master/code/signals/Mailbox02.elm>

#### view

```elm
view : Signal.Address String -> String -> Html
view address message =
  Html.div
    []
    [ Html.div [] [ Html.text message ]
    , Html.button
        [ Events.onClick address "Hello"
        ]
        [ Html.text "Click" ]
    ]
```

The `view` function now takes a `Signal.Address` as first argument.

`Events.onClick address "Hello"` sets an event listener that listens for clicks on this Html element. `onClick` sends the given message (e.g. "Hello") to the given address each time this element is clicked.

#### main

```elm
main : Signal Html
main =
  Signal.map (view mb.address) mb.signal
```

In `main` we do two things:

- Create a partially applied view `(view mb.address)`, so the view always gets the `address` of our mailbox as first argument.

- And map the output signal of our __mailbox__ to this partially applied view. `view` will get the value coming from the mailbox signal as second argument.

### Conclusion

Mailboxes are communication hubs, they receive messages from our UI and broadcast them to other parts of our application. They are an integral building block when creating complex web applications.
